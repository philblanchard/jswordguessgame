# jswordguessgame

### Overview

This game is fairly simplistic and often annoying. It will alert you a lot. There is a potential ~1000 words and I didn't add any clues.

### How to Play

You get 5 incorrect guesses and then you lose.
To begin, press the 'Start/Restart' button. This will select a word at random and kick things off.
Press the green buttons to select the letter you like.
After winning or losing, the game will reset automatically.
